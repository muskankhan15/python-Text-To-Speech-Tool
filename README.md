# python-Text-To-Speech-Tool
This Python script uses the pyttsx3 text-to-speech library to convert text into spoken audio. It initializes the speech engine, inputs a message, and plays it aloud using runAndWait(). The program outputs a welcome message saying “welcome muskan khan” through the system speakers.
